Graph Drawer
============

A visual aide for various graphing algorithms.

This program lets you draw a graph on the screen. You can select an algorithm, choose the inputs to the algorithm and then watch what it is doing iteration-by-iteration.

The program is roughly structured in the model-view-controller pattern. The model is captured by the algorithms and graph package. The view is captured by the various classes in the gui, which pass all events and interactions to the UI class, which is the controller.
